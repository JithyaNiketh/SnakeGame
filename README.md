🌟 About the Project
  This is a Java-based Snake Game designed to provide an interactive and fun gaming experience. The game window is built using Java Swing, and the logic is implemented in a modular way across three Java files:

  SnakeGame.java: Entry point for the game.
  GameFrameS.java: Sets up the main game window.
  GamePanelS.java: Contains the game logic and rendering.

🛠️ Technologies Used
  Programming Language: Java
  GUI Library: Java Swing
  Development Environment: Any IDE (Personal Preference. I used VS Code.)

🎮 How to Play
  Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:
  Up: Move Up
  Down: Move Down
  Left: Move Left
  Right: Move Right
  Collect the red apples to grow the snake and increase your score.
  Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's body to keep the game running.
